# Ordinary Differential Equations & Linear Algebra 

This repository documents my  study of the textbook
*Differential Equations and Linear Algebra* by Gilbert Strang. My goal is to develop a deeper applied understanding of Differential Equations, Numerical Methods and Linear Algebra by applying the theory learned in the book with computational methods in Python.

Each notebook connects:
- theory section
- numerical implementation in Python,
- visual interpretation of the results.
