# Ordinary Differential Equations & Linear Algebra 

This repository documents my independent studyof Gilbert Strangâ€™s textbook
*Differential Equations and Linear Algebra*. My goal is to develop a **deep,
applied understanding** of Differential Equations, Numerical Methods and Linear Algebra by applying the theory learned through the book with computational methods in Python.

Each notebook connects:
- theory
- numerical implementation in Python,
- visual interpretation of the results.
